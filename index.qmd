Hi, my name is Michael, and welcome to my website!

Below you will learn a little about myself, but feel free to explore through the sections above.

# Skills

I've gained experience in many different subjects, including music, visual marketing, cinematography, photography, graphic design, and data analytics. Much of my experience comes from hands-on learning as I've taught myself many of these skill-sets over the years as I've pursued different endeavors and learned along the way. I still have many more things I'd like to learn, but those will all come with time!

# Education

My educational journey began with music in mind. After graduating high school, I pursued a degree in music, specifically around music technology and business. I later added a second major in business, with an emphasis in marketing management. Once I graduated, I built up my photo and video business, catering to events, marketing content, and entrepreneurship. Eventually, I returned to school to pursue my master's degree in digital marketing at Cal Poly Pomona, which is where I received my first two bachelor's degrees.

# Career

After having spent so much time honing my skills behind the camera and in entertainment, I would like to keep that in my trajectory while pursuing a career. At the same time, I wish to also pursue a career in marketing, where I can lead teams that bring big ideas to life through marketing campaigns, digital content, and visual entertainment.

# Question 4
